#Quick Start
After cloning the repository open the `keys.json` file located in the directory `UnleashedToMintsoftStockSync/UnleashedToMintsoftStockSync/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/keys/`
Alternatively you can comment out or delete the `LoadJson()` method run in `Main()` in Program.cs and load the values as hardcoded strings in the `LoadHardCode()` method. Remember to uncomment this in the `Main()` method.
